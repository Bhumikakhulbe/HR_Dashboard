This project is an interactive HR Dashboard built using Power BI, aimed at providing data-driven insights into employee performance, current workforce status, and strategic decision-making related to promotions and retrenchments.

The dashboard presents a clear view of:

1. The current working employees

2. Key employee demographics and performance metrics

3. Identification of employees suitable for promotion

4. Detection of employees who may need to be retrenched

All data was cleaned, transformed, and modeled using Power Query and DAX to ensure optimal performance and customization.
